## Project Description
The goal of the project was to prepare code and a presentation for the MinneMUDAC competition in March of 2023. More information on the event can be found [here][minne-link]. Our main objecttive of the project was to help the Minnesota Twins MLB Franchise to see if we could create models that predict the seasonal attendance for 2023. We were also tasked with finding solutions and business plans that might assist in the increasing of overall attendance. The placement for our undergrad team of 5 members was 4th out of rough 25 undergrad teams.
